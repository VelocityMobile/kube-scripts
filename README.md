# kube-scripts
A set of handy kubernetes deployment and management scripts

# Cluster Creation
Use `kops` to create your cluster, then copy the relevant files to a new folder in the `staging` or `production` folders. See the example clusters for more info.

# Cluster management
You can use the ./cluster-management/apply-kube-configs script to apply all the kubernetes configs to your environment.

e.g.

```
```

# Deploying on AWS

```
export DOCKER_REGISTRY_HOST=005303308987.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

```
